# Operating System Lab Tasks

This Course contains a collection of lab tasks and assignments related to the study of Operating Systems (OS). The tasks cover various core OS concepts, including process management, memory management, file systems, I/O systems, and more. The aim is to provide hands-on experience with real-world operating system functionalities.

## Introduction

Operating System Lab Tasks are designed to help students and professionals understand how operating systems work by implementing and experimenting with different OS features. Each task aims to cover a particular concept and provide a practical understanding of its implementation.

In this repository, you'll find tasks focused on:

- Process creation and scheduling
- Memory management techniques
- File system operations
- System calls and interrupt handling
- Resource management and synchronization

## Lab Tasks Overview

The repository includes several lab tasks designed to enhance your understanding of operating system concepts. Each task is self-contained with clear objectives and instructions. The following topics are covered in the lab tasks:

1. **Process Management**
   - Task 1: Implementing Process Scheduling Algorithms (e.g., FCFS, Round Robin, SJF)
   - Task 2: Implementing Inter-process Communication (IPC) using pipes or message queues
   - Task 3: Process synchronization using semaphores or mutexes

2. **Memory Management**
   - Task 4: Implementing memory allocation algorithms (e.g., First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit)
   - Task 5: Simulating virtual memory and page replacement algorithms (e.g., FIFO, LRU)

3. **File Systems**
   - Task 6: Simulating file creation, deletion, and reading from disk
   - Task 7: Implementing basic file system operations like directory traversal and file access

4. **Input/Output Systems**
   - Task 8: Implementing interrupt handling and I/O scheduling
   - Task 9: Simulating buffer management in OS

5. **Advanced Topics**
   - Task 10: Implementing basic concepts of deadlock detection and avoidance
   - Task 11: Simulating multi-threading and synchronization in an OS environment
